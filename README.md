# Brave and the Basic Attention Token

*Brave Browser and the Basic Attention Token

*Brave was founded by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy on May 28, 2015. 
Brendan Eich is the creator of Java Script and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation. 
Brian Bondy is CTO of Brave and was part of the Mozilla team under Brendan.

*In January 2016 Brave launched the first version with an ad Blocking feature and announced plans for a privacy respecting ad-feature and revenue sharing program.

*Brave recieved $7 million in Angel investments in August 2016. Then in May of 2017 Brave held an ICO and raised $35 million. 

*Brave's central idea is to re incentivize the web browsing experience with a focus on privacy. Using the Basic attention token Brave has re-imagined the flow.

# Business Activities

* Brave has reimagined the web browsing experience. Browsing with Brave changes the incentive strucure of both users and advertisers while preserving the privacy of the user. Using the Basic attention token, Brave compensates users for there add attention. Users recieve a BAT token or now fraction of a BAT token to view adds in their browser. Brave does this while preserving the privacy of a specific user by not allowing user data to be collected by the browser or third party websites. Advertisers no longer need to pay large sums to intermidiaries such as google or facebook to get there message out to web browsers. Advertisers can purchase BAT on the open market to run adds through the Brave browser. 70% percent of tokens bought are then distributed to users compensating them for their ad viewing time. 

* Brave's potential market is massive with an average of 4.5 billion daily internet users. Google and Facebook who combined had add revenue of approximately 231 billion and together represent $2.3 trillion dollars of market cap. The online and mobile add market are massive. Brave is focusing on privacy, any internet user that is tired of having their data tracked across the internet is a prime target for using brave. One of the more interesting things about Brave's approach is that it goes right to the heart of how Google and Facebook make there money, with up to 60% of their earnings coming from advertisers. Unless Google and Facebook want to completely change their main business model, Brave is really alone in the space of compensating users for there ad viewing time.
