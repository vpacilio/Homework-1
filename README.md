# Brave and the Basic Attention Token

*Brave Browser and the Basic Attention Token

*Brave was founded by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy on May 28, 2015. 
Brendan Eich is the creator of Java Script and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation. 
Brian Bondy is CTO of Brave and was part of the Mozilla team under Brendan.

*In January 2016 Brave launched the first version with an ad Blocking feature and announced plans for a privacy respecting ad-feature and revenue sharing program.

*Brave recieved $7 million in Angel investments in August 2016. Then in May of 2017 Brave held an ICO and raised $35 million. 

*Brave's central idea is to reincentivize the web browsing experience with a focus on privacy. Using the Basic attention token Brave has re-imagined the browsing experience between user, advertiser and content creator.

# Business Activities

* Brave has re-imagined the web browsing experience. Browsing with Brave changes the incentive strucure of both users and advertisers while preserving the privacy of the user. Using the Basic attention token, Brave compensates users for there ad attention. Users recieve a BAT token or now fraction of a BAT token to view adds in their browser. Brave does this while preserving the privacy of a specific user by not allowing user data to be collected by the browser or third party websites. Advertisers no longer need to pay large sums to intermidiaries such as Google and Facebook to get there message out to web users. Advertisers can purchase BAT on the open market to run adds through the Brave browser. 70% percent of tokens bought are then distributed to users compensating them for their ad viewing time. 

* Brave's potential market is massive with an average of 4.5 billion daily internet users. Google and Facebook who combined have add revenue of approximately $231 billion, together represent $2.3 trillion dollars of market cap. The online and mobile add market are massive. Brave is focusing on privacy, any internet user that is tired of having their data tracked across the internet is a prime target for using Brave. One of the more interesting things about Brave's approach is that it goes right to the heart of how Google and Facebook make there money, with up to 60% of their earnings coming from advertisers. Unless Google and Facebook want to completely change their main business model, Brave is really alone in the space of compensating users for there ad viewing time.

* Brave browser uses the Basic Attention Token cryptocurrency to compensate user's for their add viewing. Brave is built on top of Chromium so it looks and feels very similar to the worlds most popular browser Google Chrome. The back end technologies that power Chrome, include Blink rendering engine and the V8 Javascript engine also power Brave. 

# Landscape

* Brave has pushed a new advertising framework into the advertising industry. Ad tech that reincentivizes users attention and advertisers like never before. The Brave browser has tiny market share compared to Google Chrome and even smaller browsers like Safari, but has been growing users rapidly in browser space.

* The trend for advertising is growing quickly in the online and mobile space. Just today Facebook and Google both reported better than expected earnings on higher advertising revenue. According to statista online advertising revenue grew from a $26 billion dollar industry in 2010 to a $139 billion dollar industry in 2020. Another key piece of the advertising landscape is user privacy. Users have grown more concerned over their online privacy, in a 2019 Pew study of 4,272 adults surveyed 81% of respondents said they have little of no control over their user data companies collect online.

* The internet browser space is heavily dominated by Google and their browser google chrome, they have about 64% market share. The next largest browser is apple's safari with about 19%. 

# Results

* Overall the company has grown expontially since inception. Brave curently has 29 million monthly active users and 9.8 million daily users. Basic Attention Token is in 12 million unique wallet addresses. Brave has had 2,500 different ad campains run with 400 plus unique advertisers to date. Brave is currently operating in over 190 countries around the world. 

* The best overall metric for browser usage should be the amount of users, daily or monthly. Brave has grown their user base to 29 million monthly users and 9.8 daily users as of April 2021.

* Comparably speaking Brave is tiny. Compared to Google Chrome's 64%, Safari's 19% and Firefox's 4% market share of the nearly 4.5 billion daily interent users Brave's .002% doesn't compare. 

# Recommendations

* I think one of the biggest use cases for BAT is a pay per article transaction within the Brave browser.
Being able to usefully and seemlessly spend BAT on content without needing to sign up with a credit card and then subscribe for a monthly fee would eliminate a huge point of sale transaction barrier. I would happily pay a fraction of a BAT for content behind a paywall but I'm not willing to spend $5 a month for 7 deifferent websites to read 2 articles a month. Pay per article will add value to both creators and consumers of content. Websites or content creators can continue to keep the subsrciption model but adding a pay per transaction model seems like a great value add for all parties. 

* The best way to add a pay per transaction model is using BAT. Cryptocurrency is very low fee compared to Visa's 2-4% transaction fee per purchase. The ability to have a crypto wallet within your Brave browser enables you to seemlessly browse the web paying as you go for articles or content you are interested.
